### Task 1. Optimization of production

The company produces two types of drinks: "Lemonade" and "Fruit juice". Different ingredients and a limited amount of equipment are used to produce these drinks. The challenge is to maximize production given limited resources.

**Task conditions:**

1. "Lemonade" is made from "Water", "Sugar" and "Lemon juice".
2. "Fruit juice" is made from "Fruit puree" and "Water".
3. Resource limit: 100 units. "Waters", 50 units. "Sugar", 30 units. "Lemon juice" and 40 units. "Fruit puree".
4. Production of a unit of "Lemonade" requires 2 units. "Waters", 1 unit "Sugar" and 1 unit "Lemon juice".

The production of a unit of "Fruit juice" requires 2 units. "Fruit puree" and 1 unit "Waters".
Using PuLP, create a model that determines how much "Lemonade" and "Fruit Juice" should be produced to maximize the total amount of products, subject to resource constraints. Write a program whose code maximizes the total number of products "Lemonade" and "Fruit Juice" produced, given the constraints on the number of resources.

### Task 2. Calculation of the definite integral.

Your second task is to calculate the value of the integral of the function using the Monte Carlo method.
